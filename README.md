# CS-255

1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client, DriverPass, wants to provide their customers better driving training and take advantage of the market’s void in this area.
DriverPass wants a system with the ability to handle purchases (packages), provide online classes, practice tests, virtual training, 
in person and on-the-road training, and reservations. The system must also be able to be administratively managed by their employees.

2. What did you do particularly well?

I think I did well with the Business Requirements Document. Once we started building up on DriverPass' material, I was able to
incorporate better the information that was important for the project.
   
3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

My UML diagrams and Gantt chart. While I am proud of my work, I think that I will be able to do better with time, in regards to diagrams.
Diagrams are always on the more complex side for me, as I might overlook something important and not notice until having it
revised by someone who works on the same field that I'm studying.

4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The users (student drivers) are the most important part of this project. Paying attention to their needs will ensure you succeed in Project One and Two.
My main focus was the Interview Transcript. I took everything that I could from that transcript, and implemented it into the projects.
From how the system will work, to what the students will, or should be able to achieve.

5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

For future system designs, I would start by creating UML diagrams to understand better and be able to vizualize the system.
Another thing I would do is to write down the functional and non-functional requirements. These are also as important as UML diagrams.
